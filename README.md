## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Amazon Scraper (`amazon_scrapper.py`)
- **What it does**: Scrapes the top 10 products from specified Amazon bestseller categories.
- **Process**:
  - Sends HTTP requests with a custom User-Agent to mimic a browser.
  - Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract product details (title, URL, price).
  - Clears the Google Sheet and writes category-wise tables with headers.
- **Output**: A Google Sheet (`Amazon Scrapped Data`) with organized product data.

### 2. Pinterest RSS to Google Sheets (`pinterest_to_sheets.py`)
- **What it does**: Fetches and processes pins from the Save Sphere Pinterest RSS feed.
- **Process**:
  - Parses the RSS feed using `feedparser` to extract pin details.
  - Extracts image URLs from descriptions and removes HTML tags.
  - Filters out duplicate pins by checking existing links in the Google Sheet.
  - Appends new pins to the `Pinterest Pins` worksheet.
- **Output**: A Google Sheet with columns for Title, Link, Image, Description, Published Date, and Affiliate Link.

### 3. Affiliate Link Extraction (`extract_affiliate_links.py`)
- **What it does**: Extracts Amazon affiliate links from pin descriptions.
- **Process**:
  - Reads the `Pinterest Pins` worksheet into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - Uses regex to find `amzn.to` links in descriptions.
  - Adds or updates the `Affiliate Link` column in the Google Sheet.
- **Output**: Updated Google Sheet with affiliate links for each pin.

### 4. Web Interface (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
- **What it does**: Displays Pinterest pins in a visually appealing grid.
- **Process**:
  - Fetches the Pinterest RSS feed via a CORS proxy (`api.allorigins.win`).
  - Dynamically renders pins with images, titles, and links to Pinterest.
  - Features a responsive design with light/dark mode and smooth animations.
- **Output**: A user-friendly webpage showcasing Save Sphere‚Äôs latest pins.

### 5. GitHub Actions Workflows

  - Runs daily at 11:00 AM IST.
  - Sets up Python, installs dependencies, and executes `amazon_scrapper.py`.
